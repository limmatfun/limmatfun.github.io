The first thing I posted on this blog is how [I miss working on side projects](/posts/image-blogging-in-2022) and the excitement that brings. When I was a teenager I was programming websites and was really motivated and thrilled by seeing the number of users going up on those websites. I created several of them, including a website for emulator & roms, multiple ones in the web hosting directory space and also a few related to games. I also made a text-based website game and even programmed a 2D online game, heavily inspired by [Graal Online](https://www.graalonline.com/). The text-based website game was probably the most successful of all projects and it was very fulfilling to watch the number of users growing on it. I don't know if I'm romanticizing this too much but I really miss that feeling.

I think because most of the projects I made during my childhood were so influenced by games, most of my side project ideas now also mostly involve ideas relating to games. Lately however I've been growing increasingly interested in a different kind of side project. What if instead of just being another side project, what if it was actually something that could develop into a small side business? Even if it fails, it will still have been a cool experiment and I'm sure there's much to learn from it. So before jumping head first into this, I decided to start reading up on [Startup School](https://startupschool.org).

## Startup School
Startup School is a program started in 2017 by [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), which is perhaps the most successful startup accelerator in Sillicon Valley. The curriculum consists of a mix of videos and also text articles. It covers a very wide range of topics: helping you decide if founding a startup makes sense for you, how to get ideas, planning an MVP, how to talk to users, splitting equity, hiring, pricing your product and raising money.

I've now completed a few of the lessons and one of the things I realized is that what I want to do is not really a startup. The startup definition that Y Combinator uses are companies that are designed to grow fast, 100x a year. That involves a lot of blood, sweat and tears and I'm not really ready for that. What I'd like is to start small and most of all, I don't mind at all if it only grows slowly. I'd be already thrilled if I get any paying user at all. 

Below I'll share a short summary of the ones I thought were most interesting and helpful for me, from the perspective of what matters for a small side business. I'll link to text transcripts instead of videos whenever possible. I've organized them in the following order:
1. Should you start a startup?
2. How to get and evaluate startup ideas
3. Planning the initial product
4. How to get your first customers
5. How to talk to users

#### Should You Start a Startup?
I started with a lesson from Harj Taggar on [Should You Start a Startup](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/GV-should-you-start-a-startup)?

{{< youtube BUE-icVYRFU >}}

Harj mentions how in the beginning your ideas will be more like a gut feeling, blurry and unclear. You'll go through several versions of it before it becomes a potential project. To speed up this process he suggests discussing the idea with other smart people.

He then moves to what makes a good founder. The main quality that you need to bring is resilience. It's an uphill battle from the beginning, you need to convince users to use your product and push through a lot of rejection to get there. You may have built the wrong product and need to pivot it to something else. So how can you know if you're resilient enough? Unfortunately he seems to have no good answer to this question. From his experience confidence, motivation, talent are not good proxies. Instead he suggests introspecting too much and gives some practical advice:

> I also think that simply being curious about what it's like to found a startup is a fine initial motivation to start one. Actually doing a startup is the only way to know for sure if you'll enjoy it.  If you are curious about what it'd be like to start a company, start by asking yourself, what do I have to lose? Figure out what the worst case scenario looks like if you started a startup and decide if you can live with that.

The most interesting part to me was the suggestion to quickly turn the ideas into side projects. **Build a first version over a weekend, pitch it to users and see how they react.** Repeat this until the project takes shape, however small it is. The objective is not to create the next unicorn, but to get **the experience of turning ideas into reality and feeling the thrill of launching something**. I really love this lightweight approach to side projects!

Regarding if or when you should quit your job to work on a startup, Harj recommends to think less about how the side projects are going and more about if you're enjoying this process of making ideas into reality. If this energizes you and feels different than your day job, it may be a sign that it's time to quit.

## How to Get and Evaluate Startup Ideas
In this section I'll be mixing the thoughts from both
[Jared Friedman]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th8JoIan4dg)) and [Kevin Hale](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6e-how-to-evaluate-startup-ideas) on how to get and evaluate startup ideas.

{{< youtube Th8JoIan4dg >}}

four mistakes
1. not solving a real problem (solution in search of a problem)
2. tarpit ideas: common ideas that are much harder than they seem
3. not evaluating the idea, going for the very first idea without thinking if it would make a good business
4. waiting for the perfect idea. better is to be in the middle, ideal: somewhere that is a good starting point: enough interesting qualitites that can morph to the right idea.

questions to identify a good startup idea: 
 founder market fit? - team has experience in the area
	- how big is market? big now or small now but rapidly growing 
	- how acute is this problem? Ex. Brex
	- **do you have competition? competition is good.**
    most founders think that if you have competition this is bad. no, this is an indication that you're solving a real problem. if there's no competition it's either a really hard problem or no one has this problem. but if you're going an entrenched  competition you need a new insight.
	- do you want this? do we know personally someone wanting this? 
	- only recently possible or recently necessary? Ex.Checkr
	- are there good proxies for this business? a large company that does something similar, but not direct competitor.
	- is this an idea u want to work on for years? often, idea morphs, could also be boring. as it becomes succesful it tends to grow on you over time
	- is this a scalable business? 
	- is this a good idea space? a class of closely related ideas. e.g. tools for managing hotels. upselling, revenue mangement, etc. it also means you have more adjacent ideas that you can drift into.
    
    how to come up with new ideas?
	- made up idea possible, btu not best way. Organic is better.
		- long game - become expert, work at startup, just build things (thought not startup idea)
	- 7 recipes
		- start with team expertise, idea taking advantage of that expertise (Rezi)- interdomain advantage
		- start with problem encountered (Ex, Vetcove)
		- things you personally wish existsed (Ex, Doordash) - beware of tarpit
		- things that have changed recently Ex. Covid => gathertown
		- new variants of successful companies Ex. nuvo cargo
		- talk to people and ask what problems (first idea space), Ex. AtoB
		- big industries seem broken => right for disruption
		- find cofounder in yc

## How to Evaluate Startup Ideas (Kevin Hale)
A lot of people, for instance, like I had no idea or like I have too many ideas that they don't know which one to pursue because of...main reason why a lot of people are only able to work on their startup sometimes part-time. Yes, they might be stuck without resources but they didn't have conviction. They didn't know like, oh, what would I have to believe in order to say like I want to quit my job?

So for us at YC, the definition of a startup is a company that is designed or created to try to grow very quickly. So if you're not trying to build a company that grows very, very fast, then you're just building a normal company, it's a small business. And there's nothing wrong with that but these companies are the ones that investors are interested in.

So, the first is the problem. So startup idea is composed of three parts. The first part is a problem and it's basically the initial conditions. You have to explain to me, like, what is the setting for this company that allows it to be able to grow quickly. The second is the solution. This is basically what is the experiment that you're basically running within those conditions for it to grow really quickly? And the third is, what's your insight? So what's your explanation why the thing that you're going to try, your experiment is going to end up being successful? Those are the three components that I always try to figure out when I'm listening to someone's pitch. Here's a tip for talking about the problem or to know whether your problem, your initial conditions, are correct.

You go, like, I'm going to do whatever it takes to solve people, users, customers issues. The last one's a little tricky. It's what is the insight? What's the reason why this solution is going to work? And this is where a lot of companies sort of get tricked up because it's really about, like, what is your company's unfair advantage, right?

## How to plan an MVP
I then read [How to plan an MVP](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6f-how-to-plan-an-mvp) from Michael Seibel.

{{< youtube 1hHMwLxN6EM >}}

Michael again advocates for a very lightweight process, your minimum viable product (MVP) should not involve deep user research nor require long industry experience in the field your project is in. It should be as basic as possible, the very first thing you can present to users to understand if it's useful for them. It can also be helpful to talk to users before starting any development.

You should launch quickly, even if it's bad. Get initial users interacting with it as soon as possible. You need to understand if anyone is getting value out of it. Talk to your users and get feedback. Resist the temptation to thinking you know what you have to build and waiting until it's done to show it to users. You may end up building something customers don't want at all, so get feedback early.

> Hold the problem you're solving tightly, hold the customer tightly, hold the solution you're building loosely (redesign/rebuild if needed).

What I really like here is the fast approach. You should opt for a very lean MVP, built in the order of weeks not months. Michael mentions that for software products it's even easier, you can start with just a landing page and a spreadsheet. Your functionality should be restricted to the absolute minimum and avoid addressing all of the users' problems at once. Cut your spec and cut even important things if necessary.

>The goal here is just to get anything out in the world. Once you get anything out in the world, the momentum to keep anything going is extremely strong.

## How to talk to users
[How to talk to users](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6g-how-to-talk-to-users)

The goal of a great user interview is to extract information from the person that you're talking to, to extract data that will help you improve the product or improve your marketing or improve your positioning. It is not to sell them on using your product. So, at the core of a great user interview, you need to learn about their life. You need to talk about specifics around the problem area that you're trying to solve that the user may be going through.

The second mistake that we pretty much all make is we talk about hypotheticals. We talk about what our product could be. We talk about features that we want to build. We ask questions like, "If we built this feature, would you be interested in using it? Or would you be interested in paying for it?" That is wrong. Instead, talk about specifics that have already occurred in the user's life. This will give you stronger and better information in which to make product and company changing decisions. You also want to talk in general about the user's life. You don't want to just talk about the specific problem or, sorry, the specific solution that you're presenting.

Try to extract information about the users, the path that led them to encounter that problem. Ask them questions about their life in more broader ways to extract context around how they arrived at this problem. Learn about their motivations. Learn about why they got themselves into that problem in the first place. The third trap that we pretty much all fall into is that we talk, we talk a lot. We're founders, we're always pitching investors, we're pitching employees. We're trying to hire people. We're trying to partner. So, we tend to spend a lot of our time talking.

The second question to the point that I was making earlier about trying to get to specifics rather than hypotheticals is to ask the question, "Tell me about the last time that you encountered this problem." The goal of this question is actually to extract context around the circumstances in which the user encountered that problem. So, for example, in the Dropbox case, you may be talking to your friend and learn about a week ago, a specific timeframe, who were they working with? Which class were they working on? Was this a computer science problem? Was this an English paper?

Try to extract as much information as you can about the context in which they began solving this problem so that as you develop your product, you'll be able to actually reference real-life examples of past problems that potential users have had. And you can overlay your solution on top of that, to see if it would have helped in that particular circumstance.

The third question is, "Why was this hard?" Why was the circumstance in which that student was trying to work on their shared project or their project with other folks, why was that hard? What were the specific things that they encountered that were difficult? The reason why you want to ask this question is because you'll hear many different things from different people.

The fourth question is, "What, if anything, have you done to try to solve this problem?" One of the biggest things that I've encountered while helping YC companies over the last few years, is that if potential customers are not already exploring potential solutions to their problem, it's possible that the problem that you're trying to solve is not a burning enough problem for customers for them to be even interested in your better solution to this product. So, this question tries to get at the root of that issue. Is the person who encounters this problem already trying to solve this?

Again, you want to ask this question for two reasons. One is to figure out whether the problem that you're solving or you're working to solve is even really something that people are already looking for solutions to. And the second one is what are the other competitions out there? What will your product be compared against as you end up rolling out your solution and offering it to end customers? The fifth question is very tactical. "What don't you love about the solutions that you've already tried?" This is the beginning of your potential feature set. This is how you begin understanding what the features are that you'll build-out for your better solution to the problem.

Talking to users, as I said before, is useful at pretty much all stages of your company but there's three critical phases to an early-stage company. I would kind of define that as a company that has not yet reached product-market fit in which talking to users would be extremely beneficial. Those three stages are at the idea stage before you've even begun developing any of your product at the prototype stage, where you have the first kind of rough beginnings of your product but you haven't really gotten into the hands of any paying customers or any users yet. And the third one, which is after you've launched and you're iterating towards product-market fit. How do you guide that journey? So, I'll talk about a few tips for each phase.

At the idea stage, you may have the back of a napkin idea. You may have a thought, you may be commercializing some technology that you've been dreaming of but you don't yet have any first users. So, you need to begin finding the first people that will be interested in either providing information about the problem that they've encountered or potentially signing up to be your first users. People come to me and ask, "How can I talk and how can I find my first users?" Honestly, some of the best companies are products or services that are built for the founders themselves.

Another cool hack that we've seen some great success with, actually a YC company in this batch is actually selling products to firefighters. And they realized that cold email introductions was just not working, was not a way that they could get through to customers. So, what they did was they actually just dropped by fire stations in-person. They didn't even, you know, email them to say that they were coming ahead of time. They just showed up and they said, "Hey, could we speak to the fire chief? Could we talk to someone about this problem that we've got a solution to?" And you know what? It worked great. They managed to get dozens of in-person, you know, 10 to 15 minute long meetings just by showing up.

Keep it casual. Like I said before, you could just show up, you don't have to preplan. You don't have to have, you know, 20-minute blocks on your calendar scheduled for days on end of user interviews.

Honestly, you'll be able to get probably the best information out of say a 10 to 15-minute long first interview and that might be all the time you need just for that initial chat.

During user interviews at this stage, I love to ask questions that extract numerical answers to three facts about the customer that I'm working with. The first one that I want to get to the bottom of is how much does this problem cost them today? I like to get a hard number either in terms of how much revenue do they stand to earn if they solve this problem, or how much expense do they currently spend trying to solve this problem? How much money is wasted today as they try to solve this problem? The second one that I like to get to the bottom of is how frequently do they encounter this problem? Do they encounter it on an hourly basis, a daily basis, a quarterly basis, yearly basis?

The last stage before product-market fit that can benefit from user interviews is actually the process of iterating towards product-market fit.

The second main type of bad data that you may encounter is fluff. These are hypotheticals. These are generic statements. Whenever you're in the middle of a user interview and you start getting onto this hypothetical, you know, "Oh, here's what the product may look like in the future." Try to steer it back to specifics. Again, you're conducting a user interview, not to pitch your product but to learn about problems or issues that the user has faced in their past so that you can improve it in the future. That's it. That was meant to be like a quick short dive into "Talking To Users."

## How to Get Your First Customers
One of my favorite video lessons was [How to Get Your First Customers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyYCn_kAngI) from Gustaf Alströmer.

{{< youtube hyYCn_kAngI >}}

The lesson is largely based on Paul Graham's post on [Do Things That Don't Scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html). Most technical people want to avoid doing marketing or sales themselves, however Gustaf advocates that it should be the person building the project the one doing the calls, as you are the expert in the product and the process of making a sale forces you to know your users. To recruit your first users you need to really go after them and you can't just wait for them to come to you. Specially the first users tend to be the most difficult to find and you need to do things that won't scale in the future. What does this mean concretely? This means spending a lot of time thinking about how to find the potential customers and then on pursuing them: cold emailing, phone calls to demo the product and trying to delight them. Paul Graham even mentions a startup that was sending each new user a hand-written thank you note.

> Your first users should feel that signing up with you was one of the best choices they ever made. The feedback you get from engaging directly with your earliest users will be the best you ever get. [...] you can and should give users an insanely great experience with an early, incomplete, buggy product, if you make up the difference with attentiveness.

The video gives a concrete recipe on how your first e-mail to potential users should look like:
* These users do not know you, so it should be brief. 6-8 sentences.
* Clear language, no jargon, no buzzwords.
* Write in plaintext (no HTML).
* Describe the problem the users have and how you solve them.
* Say you're the founder and describe why you're impressive ("show, don't tell"; include social proof e.g. companies you have worked for, what your experience is).
* Obviously, include your website. The website needs to be simple too: screenshots of your product and bullet points of what it does. Alternatively a brief, to the point YouTube video of how your product works
* Ask for a call to speak to the customer and present a demo.

Your first customers should be your easiest (no special features required):
* You should have a big pipeline of potential customers - prioritize accordingly.
* Most of people are not early adopters - avoid them. Send hundreds of e-mails to find the right users.

Very surprisingly to me, Gustaf says that you **should resist the urge to offer your product for free** to the first customers. You should charge them because it's an early sign that it's providing value. If you already learn they don't want to pay for this, it's a sign that you should move on to the next customers ("fire" the complicated users). Instead, offer a money back guarantee.

Gustaf mentions that it's very important to understand and keep track of the conversion rates for each phase of the sales cycle, e.g.:
1. You start with 500 outreach emails.
2. 50% of those emails are opened.
3. 5% reply rate (20 replies).
4. 50% agree to setup a demo (10 demos).
5. 20% become paying customers (2 customers).

Using the numbers above, to get your first 10 customers you'd need to send 2500 e-mails! It's normal to face a lot of rejection. It's important to make sure you're reaching enough people, as otherwise you may not have enough data to understand all your conversion rates. Sales is a numbers game.
