I don't think I've organized my thoughts on this quite well yet, but wanted to give it a try by writing about it. Lately I've been thinking a lot about work. And luckily, not about what I have to do at work, but rather about work in general. I'm in the very privileged position where I feel accomplished at the company I'm currently in and also that I'm being compensated well. I've saved up quite a bit and continue to save a decent amount every year. I follow the conventional wisdom of investing my money in ETFs.

## Money
From the people I've talked with, who are in the same privileged position as I am, it's clear that most of them have not given money much thought (except that it's good to accumulate it). Of course there's comfort and security in knowing that you have a large nest egg. Of course you can use extra money to go on nice vacations, go out, eat in michelin restaurants or buying yourself the latest gadget. But for what scenarios are you making this egg, and how large should it be? Maybe one of the major uses of money is buying property. The average apartment listing price in the city of Zurich is [1.49M swiss francs](https://realadvisor.ch/de/immobilienpreise-pro-m2/stadt-zurich). In Switzerland you need a 20% deposit to finance the rest with a mortage. Half of it can come from your pension fund and the rest must be cash. So you must have 150k to finance this property. Even ignoring the fact that rationally buying property is currently not a wise decision ([renting is estimated to be 35% cheaper than buying](https://www.srf.ch/news/wirtschaft/immobilien-in-der-schweiz-wo-mieten-guenstiger-ist-als-kaufen-pruefen-sie-ihre-gemeinde)), let's assume you have already accumulated more than that. And your egg continues to grow fast. What do you with money? Buy a bigger house?

## Time
Spoiler alert: I think the answer for me is time. I've read quite a few articles which I found to be thought-provoking on this topic. My favorite is [Life is not short](https://dkb.show/post/life-is-not-short). I'm going to be quoting it generously.

> In your mind, you genuinely think you’re going to live forever. You think you have an infinite supply of time, and you keep spending it on the first thing that pops up without giving it much thought.
> 
> You can’t touch or feel time, so it’s hard for you to really grasp it. If your doctor told you that you had a deadly illness, you’d spend every cent you have to try to stay alive. That’s how much your time is actually worth to you. But on a day to day basis, you treat it like it’s completely worthless, just because you can’t see it.

The first paragraph rings true to me. It's morbid to think about death, so I think, I (like probably most people) simply avoid thinking about it. It feels so far away and it's convenient to ignore it. So you spend time without thinking too much about it. And most of your non-sleeping time goes to work. I don't think I've ever heard of people's regret being not having worked enough.

> It’s even worse when people come up with deferred life plans. They’ll say something like “When I’m forty, I’m going to retire and write a book” or “I’ll do this thing I hate right now so I can make money, then in ten years I’ll do what I really love”.
>
> Putting things off for the future is the biggest waste of a life. You deny yourself the present by promising the future. You’re relying on the future, which is outside of your control, and abandoning the present, which is the only thing you can control.

I actually like the work that I do, so I don't think I'm the situation of "hating right now". However I can absolutely see myself deferring life plans. I started thinking about working 80% when I got promoted 3 years ago. But then I put it off because I thought I was still too young to do such a thing, plus I should get promoted one more time before doing such a thing. But why? Should you achieve a certain arbritary seniority at work or age before one can work less? It seems like the answer is because then you are more successful, you make more money. But doesn't this all go back to, what do you with all this money in the end? 

> You should live your life intentionally, instead of having your time stolen from you little by little. You should organize each day as if it were your last, so that you neither need to long for nor fear the next day. You should avoid spending time on people and things that don’t really matter to you.

I love this paragraph. I don't think the author is actually making an argument for #YOLO, but rather that having it in the back of your mind that there is an end can help you focus on what really matters for you.

Interestingly there's another article I really liked which has the opposite title: [Life is short](http://paulgraham.com/vb.html). If you read it carefully they're actually sending exactly the same message:



*  [In Praise of Idleness](https://harpers.org/archive/1932/10/in-praise-of-idleness/) (by Bertrand Russell, 1932)
