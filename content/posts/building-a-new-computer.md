After 11 happy years with my current desktop it was finally showing signs of decay. I started getting BSoDs randomly but frequently, roughly every 30 minutes. Always watchdog alerts (?), which can be a bunch of different things. I bought most of the parts 11 years ago and assembled it myself:
* part, date of purchase, price
* power supply
* housing
* CPU
* GPU
* Motherboard
* RAM
* HDD
* 250gb SSD, with Windows 10.
* 60gb SSD, with Debian.

I have a strong suspicion it's actually my 250GB SSD that is dying as I get no crash on Linux. It's actually quite surprising that my HDD is still going strong after such a long time. I tried some debugging (what's the right word?) tools for SSD but actually none found an issue. Perhaps it's not the SSD afterall.

Anyways, everything is so old that even Windows is reminding me that I can't upgrade to Windows 11 as my parts are not supported. I agree with Microsoft and decided it's time to actually change the entire setup.

## Deciding on the new parts
It has been such a long time since I last built a PC that I barely even know where to start. I just know I want something silent and hopefully a bit more compact. I reach out to my brother for advice and he introduces me to the tiny PC he uses as home server. The box is so small it doesn't support a GPU, but that's actually totally OK with me. I don't game that much and when I do I usually do it on my [Nintendo Switch](TODO).

Here are all the parts I bought and their prices:
* part, price

Talk about order of assembly and which order would have made more sense.
Connecting the cooler was the trickiest one.

Connecting the antennas to the wifi chip was also very finnicky.
