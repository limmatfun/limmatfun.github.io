Motivating to think you can launch with something you build on a weekend or in a week
thinking about startup school, attracted by idea of trying something until it sticks
use adwords to try to get customers
simple products to iterate on and learn things

Videos from startup school

Idea: Dynamic pricing tailored for a city / area.

How to get data:
Scrape booking.com information? All hotels seem to be getting occupancy rates from somewhere, start logging it.

How to get customers
E-mail new hotels on booking.com? Emails hotels that currently do not use dynamic pricing?

## MVP
Just a landing page
Let user pick city in switzerland; enter a city to get started
* chart on occupancy rates over time
* next events in the city
* average price per night by number of stars

Tabs to simulate dynamic pricing
* Based on days of the week
* Based on next events
* Based on simulated occupancy rates (discount when empty; surcharge when full)

Chart on how much more rent you could extract

## Pricing
Haven't given much thought, but should be a win-win kind of pricing. Users only pay when dynamic pricing is able to extract more money. Your interests are then aligned.
