### Buying a property: the costs

I have been trying to collect all associated costs with buying-to-let property. I tried simulating it with a specific property (just looked for "apartment building" on homegate and picked up something that had clear documentation). This is what I have so far.

Assorted learnings:
*  For buy-to-let your income does not play a role. What plays a role is that Rental Income > All costs by some margin.
*  For buy-to-let you must have a downpayment of at least 25%
*  For buy-to-let you must reduce your mortgage to 65% within 10 years (instead of 15).
*  Capital gain tax (when selling a property for more than you bought): ?
*  Wealth tax on mortgage?

Recurring costs:
*  General maintenance: 1% of value of property
*  Building insurance: Canton-dependent (https://www.comparis.ch/hausrat-versicherung/hausratversicherung/gebaeudeversicherung) but seems negligible compared to the other costs. 
*  Property tax: Canton-dependent, mostly 0 in german-speaking Cantons
*  Tenant insurance: Protects against tenants not paying rent and an apartment being empty for a long time. Not sure if necessary nor how much it costs
*  Management costs ("Verwaltung"): 3.5% bis 5% without new letting (https://www.cash.ch/news/top-news/immobilien-verwalten-lassen-wann-es-sich-lohnt-was-es-kostet-419274). With new letting 12% (!). (Tax deductible: https://www.shkb.ch/828-steuertipps-fuer-liegenschaftsbesitzende and https://moneypark.ch/news-wissen/hypotheken-und-zinsen/steuern-bei-renditeliegenschaften/)
*  Mortgage interest rates: 1.75% bis 2% (tax deductible)
*  Amortization of the mortgage down to 65 % within 10 years: ?
*  Income tax on rental income: Your marginal tax rate, I think.

One-off costs:
*  Mostly notary fees (typically contains some other taxes, not sure what exactly): mostly canton-dependent how much and who pays for it (buyer or seller), some ads seem to split this cost. 2 to 5%

Now simulating it for a specific property.

Property:
*  https://www.homegate.ch/kaufen/4001181128. Price 1.6M, net rental income: 71k
*  400k downpayment
*  1200k mortgage
*  Marginal tax rate: 40%

Costs:
*  Management costs (12% for full service; tax-deductible): 71k*12%*(100%-40%)=5.1k
*  Building insurance (taken from documentation): ~0.5k CHF
*  Maintenance (1% of total cost): 16k
*  Mortgage interest rate (2%, tax deductible): 1200*2%*(100%-40%): 14.4k
*  Income tax on rent: 71k*40% = 28.4k
*  Amortisation: ?
*  Total costs: 64.4k

Which gives a measly yield of (71k-64.4k) / (downpayment of 400k) = 1.6%. I'm hoping there's something wrong with my calculations, or maybe this just means this is not a good property. It's still missing the amortization costs and doesn't take appreciation into consideration.

Don't trade extra yield for more work (managing a property)
