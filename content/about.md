This blog is an ode to the [Limmat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limmat). Limmat is a river flowing from Lake Zurich. It flows through the city and is one of the main sources for cooling down during summer. The water from the river is translucid and has a beautiful shade of blue.

### About me
I'm a software engineer living in Zurich. I live about 5 minutes walking from the spot pictured above and love summer in this city. There's nothing better than going jogging in the morning and then jumping in the river to cooldown.

During summer I also enjoy making a barbecue with friends and relaxing on my balcony.
